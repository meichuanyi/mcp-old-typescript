# IBM MCP

A collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, MCP Clients and Developer Tools by IBM. Connect your IBM products to any AI Agent or AI application.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open-source protocol designed to enable AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This collection of IBM MCP services focuses on both production-ready and experimental MCP servers that enhance AI capabilities by providing file access, database connections, API integrations, and additional contextual services.

## FAQ

### General

**What is MCP?**
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect to external data sources and tools. It provides a universal interface for AI models to interact with APIs, databases, and services.

**Why use IBM MCP Servers?**
IBM MCP Servers provide production-ready, enterprise-grade MCP server implementations for IBM services including Cloud Object Storage, Watson Discovery, and more. They follow security best practices and include proper input validation.

### Getting Started

**How do I install an MCP server?**
Each MCP server in this collection has its own installation instructions. Most can be installed via npm, uvx, or Docker. See the individual server README for details.

**Which MCP clients are compatible?**
Any client that supports the MCP protocol works with these servers. Supported clients include VS Code (with MCP extension), Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible AI applications.

**Do I need IBM Cloud credentials?**
It depends on the server. Servers that connect to IBM Cloud services (like Cloud Object Storage) require IBM Cloud credentials. Local servers may not need any credentials.

### Configuration

**How do I configure MCP servers in my client?**
Add the server configuration to your client's `mcp.json` file. Each server README includes the exact configuration snippet. For VS Code, you can use the one-click install button if available.

**How do I manage API keys and credentials?**
Store credentials as environment variables or in a `.env` file. Never commit credentials to version control. Each server README specifies the required environment variables.

**Can I run multiple MCP servers simultaneously?**
Yes. Each MCP server runs as a separate process. Configure each server in your client's MCP configuration file with unique names.

### Troubleshooting

**Why is my MCP server not connecting?**
Check that:
1. All required environment variables are set
2. The server process is running
3. Your MCP client is configured with the correct server path
4. Network connectivity to the target service is available

**How do I debug MCP server issues?**
Enable debug logging in your MCP client. Check the server logs for error messages. Verify your credentials and network connectivity.

**Where can I get help?**
- **GitHub Issues**: [Report bugs or request features](https://github.com/IBM/mcp/issues)
- **Discord**: [Join the MCP community](https://discord.com/invite/TMNc2tXbNc)
- **Documentation**: See individual server READMEs for detailed setup guides
